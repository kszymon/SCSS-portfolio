**Project Title: SCSS-portfolio**

**Description:**
This project showcases a one-page website developed using the SCSS preprocessor and adhering to the Block, Element, Modifier (BEM) methodology. The website highlights the effective utilization of various SCSS features, including variables, nesting, structure, mixins, extends, mathematical operators, lists, maps, and logic.

**Key Features:**
1. **SCSS Preprocessor:** The entire website is developed using SCSS to enhance maintainability and readability of the code.
2. **BEM Methodology:** The code follows the BEM methodology (Block, Element, Modifier) to create a clear and modular structure, making it easier to manage and scale.
3. **Variables:** SCSS variables are employed to store and reuse values throughout the stylesheets, promoting consistency and easy updates.
4. **Nesting:** SCSS nesting is utilized for a hierarchical representation of styles, improving the organization and readability of the code.
5. **Mixins:** Reusable code snippets (mixins) are implemented to encapsulate style patterns and facilitate code maintainability.
6. **Extends:** SCSS extends are employed to share styles between selectors, reducing redundancy and promoting a more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) codebase.
7. **Mathematical Operators:** SCSS mathematical operators are used for dynamic and responsive styling, allowing for calculations within style rules.
8. **Lists and Maps:** SCSS lists and maps are leveraged for efficient storage and iteration of data, enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the code.
9. **Logic:** Conditional statements and logical operations in SCSS are employed for creating responsive and adaptive styles based on specific conditions.

**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the SCSS files in the project to understand the structure and implementation of various features.
3. Customize and extend the code as needed for your own one-page website projects.
